My dear family and my love <b>Dingyi</b> have given me full care and great confidence in my academic journey. They are the strength and source of my struggle.

Besides, <b>Football</b> is one of my few spiritual sustenances, and my time in the School of Mathematics and Computaional Science's team is always worth remembering.
